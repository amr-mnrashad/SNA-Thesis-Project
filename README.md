Topic of my thesis project:  

Generating a network of subreddits and users, with the aim of identifying communities, computing PageRank scores and being able to incorporate such information when developing a recommendation system.

The dataset folder contains the 100 csv files, each file represents a subreddit and it contains around 1000 rows.

There are two notebooks, one is used for data collection using reddit's API and the other notebook contains the project code

Finally, there are two csv files, nodes & edges, created in order to perform visualizations on Gephi
